### Duration: 1hr:35 minutes (12:25 PM - 2:00 PM GMT) Impact: Users were unable to access the application websites, resulting in a loss of reporting time. Approximately 10% of users were affected.
Root Cause: A recent construction works near our office fibre lines resulted in fibre cut that connects the office to the internet service provider and caused an outage to internet access by the office.

Timeline:
12:25 PM - The issue was first detected when our monitoring system alerted us to a 5 of our applications severs were down.
12:30 PM - The engineering team was notified of the issue and began investigating.
12:35 PM - Initial investigations suggested that the issue was related to transmissions as ping requests were not reaching the last mile.
12:40 PM - Further investigations revealed that the transmission system was up and running, however, the  issue was actually related to internet service as the network availabitlity status went dark.
12:50 PM - The team discovered a fibre cut as connectivity was not being established using fibre connection but only through a redundant means of microwave.
1:00 PM - The incident was escalated to the ISP provider.
1:10 PM - The team worked with the ISP provider to identify the source of the cut issue.
2:00 PM - The issue was resolved, and users were able to access the application websites again.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a fibre cut hindering internet accessibility of the applications servers to run th websites.
To resolve the issue, the engineering team worked with the ISP provider to identify and fix the fibrecut. The fix involved fibre splicing and dicing to remove the damaged part by the construction activity.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, the engineering team in collaboration with the ISP installed a fibre line indicator for the construction workere to note the fibre route to avoid
 construction damage.

Conducting a thorough review of all application websites were accessed to ensure they up and running. A micowave link was installed as a backup. Improving monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to similar issues more quickly in the future. Developing and documenting incident response procedures to ensure that issues are escalated and resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Tasks to address the issue:
Fibre splicing and dicing. A fibre line indicator was installed at the construction site to prevent construction workers from cutting through the fibre by knowing the route of the fibre     cable.
